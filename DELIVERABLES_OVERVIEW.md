# @kirahri.cos Strategy Package
## What's In Each Document

---

## 00 — CHEAT SHEET
**What it is:** Everything boiled down to one page. Read this first.

**Key points:**
- Tell a micro-story in every reel (something has to HAPPEN)
- Your top 4 reels = 6.2M plays. Your bottom 10 = under 1,500 each. Difference is narrative.
- Story-driven content gets 10-50x more plays than pure showcases
- Best posting day: Wednesday 11am-12pm EST
- Convention content is your viral engine — treat every con as 8-12 reels

**The one rule:** The cosplay is the costume. The content is the story. Tell the story.

---

## 01 — IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS
**What it is:** Full data breakdown of your 50 reels.

**Key findings:**
- 6.8M total plays across 50 reels
- 4 reels account for 92% of all plays
- BTS content = 11.4% avg ER (your highest pillar)
- Convention content = 9% avg ER
- Your 20-30s reels avg 200K plays vs 13K for 5-10s reels
- Comments-to-likes ratio is 5.04% — 7x higher than competitors

**What it means:** You go viral when you tell convention stories. You underperform when you post vibes with no narrative.

---

## 02 — STRATEGIC GUIDANCE
**What it is:** What to repeat, what to drop, what to film next.

**Repeat these:**
- Convention chaos reels (your top 4 are all con-adjacent)
- Authentic personal moments (trans journey content = 564K plays, 4.2% ER)
- DM/comment reaction reels (50K plays, 13.3% ER)
- Behind-the-scenes process

**Stop these:**
- Vague one-word captions ("Hmmmm" = 889 plays)
- Motivational/advice content ("Be weird and cringy!" = 1,644 plays)
- "Trial" or hesitant content ("Scared to try the trend" = 1,465 plays)
- Pure promo without a hook

**Content mix:** 4-6 reels/week. 2 Tier 1 (CON/BTS) + 2 Tier 2 (HUM/PER) + 1 Tier 3 max.

---

## 03 — COMPETITIVE SCAN
**What it is:** Analysis of 6 competitor accounts + 200 niche posts.

**Primary competitors analyzed:**
- @nikkiwoodss (415K) — at-home humor, no con required
- @danielledenicola (627K) — vulnerability content
- @sakuraflorr (150K IG, 1.2M TikTok) — BookTok crossover
- @yayahan (594K) — crafting expert lane

**What they prove you should do:**
- Film humor skits at home (post year-round, not just at cons)
- "Cosplay in public" content = 723K avg, 10.2% ER
- Question hooks drive comments → algorithm loves it

**Your moat (things no competitor can copy):**
- Convention chaos humor monopoly
- 5.04% comments-to-likes ratio (7x higher than @nikkiwoodss)
- Story-driven content edge (10-50x vs showcases)
- 4.77x replay ratio

## 04 — THREE REEL CONCEPTS
**What it is:** 3 ready-to-film reel ideas with full shot breakdowns.

**Reel 1: "The Artist Alley Damage Report"**
- Sequel to your 1.9M "went over budget" reel
- Hook: "I set a budget for Katsucon artist alley"
- 15-18 seconds, original audio
- Shot-by-shot breakdown included

**Reel 2: "Cosplayers vs. Normal People at a Convention"**
- Play both roles, contrast the chaos
- Hook: Split screen comparison
- 10-13 seconds

**Reel 3: "What Cosplay Actually Costs"**
- Lay out pieces with price tags
- Hook: "What people think this cost vs. reality"
- 17-22 seconds, designed to be saved

---

## 05 — SHOT LIST + FILMING GUIDE
**What it is:** What to film at conventions and at home.

**At conventions — must-capture:**
- The arrival (POV walking in)
- Artist alley walk (hands picking things up)
- Eating struggle (lunch in cosplay)
- Photo request interruptions
- End-of-day exhaustion

**At home — weekly batch:**
- 2-3 talking head reactions (DMs, comments)
- 1 transformation (casual → cosplay)
- BTS/process clips

**The 3-second rule:** If someone sees only the first 3 seconds, will they stay? If no, restructure.

---

## 06 — CONTENT CALENDAR
**What it is:** 8-week posting schedule mapped to pillars.

**Weekly rhythm:**
- Mon: Relatable Humor (HUM)

## 07 — CASE STUDY: TWO VIDEOS
**What it is:** Why one reel got 1.9M plays and another got 889.

**The winner: "I uhhh went over budget"**
- 1.9M plays, 20.2% ER
- Specific hook, full story arc, original audio
- 4.77x replay ratio

**The underperformer: "Hmmmm"**
- 889 plays, 3.5% ER
- Vague caption, no narrative, licensed audio that added nothing

**The pattern:** Reel A passes the 5-point checklist. Reel B passes zero.

---

## 08 — HOOK LIST BY LOCATION
**What it is:** 65 ready-to-use hooks organized by where you are.

**Locations covered:**
- Hotel room (getting ready + end of day)
- Convention floor (artist alley, walking, eating, social)
- At home (process, humor, personal)
- Car/parking lot
- In public

**Every hook has:**
- The visual (what to film)
- The caption (already written)
- The pillar (CON, BTS, HUM, PER, SOC)
- Target duration

**Example:** "Spread out everything you bought, then show your calculator" → "I told myself $50. The receipt says $187."

---

## 09 — AUDIO STRATEGY
**What it is:** When to use original audio vs. licensed, and which songs work.

**The rule:** Audio should add meaning — whether voice, song title as joke, or franchise OST.

**When to use licensed:**
- The song title IS the joke ("Just A Girl" while cosplaying)
- It's a franchise OST matching your character
- It's currently trending AND fits

**Songs that worked for you:**
- "Just A Girl" — No Doubt (69K)
- "NOT CUTE ANYMORE" — ILLIT (63K)
- "Living in the Dark" — Myuu (26K)

**Songs that failed:**
- "Golden Brown" — The Stranglers (1.8K) — added nothing to "Hmmmm"

## 12 — AUDIO CLASSIFICATION
**What it is:** Manual verification sheet for your top 30 posts.
