## THE PLAN

You're not posting daily. You're batch filming, then scheduling. Here's the exact order:

```
WEEK 1: PREPARATION
  Day 1-2: Set up your filming space + gather props
  Day 3-4: BATCH FILMING SESSION #1 (film 7-8 reels)
  Day 5-7: Edit all 7-8 reels

WEEK 2: BUILD THE BANK
  Day 1-2: BATCH FILMING SESSION #2 (film 7-8 reels)
  Day 3-5: Edit all reels
  Day 6-7: Schedule first week, prep captions

WEEK 3: LAUNCH
  Start posting 4-5 reels per week
  You now have 2 weeks of content banked
```

## YOUR FIRST BATCH FILMING SESSION

### The 7 Reels You'll Film (Session 1)

These are ordered so you minimize costume changes:

**CASUAL CLOTHES (No Cosplay Needed) — Film These First**

1. **DM Reactions** — Screen record some DMs, react to them
2. **"Things People Say"** — React to common questions cosplayers get
3. **Camera Roll Scroll** — React to your old cosplays

**PUT ON COSPLAY #1 — Film These Next**

4. **Cost Breakdown** — Lay out the pieces, show prices
5. **Transformation Reveal** — Film putting on the cosplay (time-lapse)
6. **Character Energy** — Short showcase with personality

**PUT ON COSPLAY #2 (Optional) — Film These Last**

7. **Before/After** — Side by side of early cosplay vs now
8. **Quick Trend** — Use a trending audio if one fits

### Filming Tips for Beginners

```
CAMERA:
  - Film vertical (portrait mode) ALWAYS
  - Tap and hold on your face to lock focus
  - Clean your lens before starting
  - Film in 1080p or 4K if you have space

TALKING ON CAMERA:
  - Look at the camera lens, not the screen
  - Speak louder than feels natural
  - It's okay to do multiple takes
  - Short pauses are fine — you'll edit them out

ENERGY:
  - Slightly more energy than real life
  - Smile before you start talking
  - React bigger than you would in person
  - If something goes wrong, keep filming — mistakes are content
```

## EDITING BASICS

### Apps to Use (Pick One)
```
FREE:
  - CapCut (best for beginners)
  - InShot
  - Instagram's built-in editor

PAID:
  - CapCut Pro
  - Adobe Premiere Rush
```

### The Simple Edit Formula

Every reel follows this structure:

```
1. HOOK (0-2 seconds)
   - Text overlay with the hook
   - Your face or the interesting visual

2. CONTENT (3-15 seconds)
   - The story/reveal/reaction
   - Quick cuts (2-4 seconds each)

3. END (last 1-2 seconds)
   - Punchline or reaction shot
   - This is the share moment
```

### Editing Checklist
```
[ ] Hook appears in first 1.5 seconds
[ ] Text is readable (large enough, contrasting color)
[ ] Audio is clear (or use text overlays if not)
[ ] No dead air longer than 1 second
[ ] Total duration: 8-20 seconds (sweet spot: 12-18)
[ ] End on a strong moment (reaction, punchline, reveal)
```
