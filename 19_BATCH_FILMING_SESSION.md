# Batch Filming Session Guide
## Film 2 Weeks of Content in One Day

---

## THE GOAL

In one 3-hour session, you'll film 7-8 reels. Two sessions = 14 reels = 2+ weeks of content before you post anything.

---

## BEFORE THE SESSION

### The Night Before
```
[ ] Pick your 7-8 scripts from 18_SCRIPTS_WORD_FOR_WORD.md
[ ] Read each script out loud once
[ ] Lay out your cosplay(s) — ready to put on
[ ] Charge your phone to 100%
[ ] Check storage — need at least 5GB free
[ ] Set out props/items for cost breakdown reel
[ ] Have water and snacks nearby
```

### Morning Of
```
[ ] Shower (fresh face for camera)
[ ] Do basic makeup if needed (even just concealer helps on camera)
[ ] Put hair in easy-to-wig state
[ ] Eat before you start (filming on empty stomach = low energy)
[ ] Set up your filming space
[ ] Do NOT scroll social media first — keep your energy fresh
```

---

## FILMING SPACE SETUP

### 15 Minutes Before You Start

```
LIGHTING:
  [ ] Face the window (natural light on your face)
  [ ] If no window: ring light at 45-degree angle
  [ ] Test with selfie — can you see your face clearly?
  [ ] No harsh shadows under eyes or nose

BACKGROUND:
  [ ] Clean/plain wall
  [ ] OR cosplay storage visible (adds character)
  [ ] Remove anything distracting

TRIPOD POSITION:
  Position 1: Eye level, close (for talking head)
  Position 2: 6-8 feet back, full body (for reveals)

SOUND CHECK:
  [ ] Record 5 seconds, play back
  [ ] Can you hear yourself clearly?
  [ ] Turn off TV, music, fans if too loud
```

## THE 3-HOUR SESSION

### Hour 1: Casual Clothes (No Cosplay)
**Reels 1-3: DM Reactions, Things People Say, Camera Roll**

```
0:00-0:10 — SCRIPT 1: DM Reactions
  [ ] Screen record 3-4 DMs beforehand
  [ ] Film your face reacting to each
  [ ] Do 2-3 takes of each reaction
  [ ] Move quickly — this is easy content

0:10-0:25 — SCRIPT 2: Things People Say
  [ ] You'll add text overlays in editing
  [ ] Film 4-5 reaction faces
  [ ] Make them distinct (confused, pained, accepting)
  [ ] One take each is fine

0:25-0:40 — SCRIPT 3: Camera Roll Scroll
  [ ] Screen record scrolling through old cosplays
  [ ] Film yourself reacting to 4-5 of them
  [ ] Be honest — cringe at the bad ones
  [ ] 2 takes max

0:40-0:50 — SCRIPT 8: Closet Tour (bonus if time)
  [ ] Walk to your cosplay storage
  [ ] Film the chaos
  [ ] React to wig collection
  [ ] One continuous take is fine
```

**Break: 5 minutes. Drink water. Check footage looks good.**

**Reels 4-7: Cost Breakdown, Transformation, Showcase, Trend**

```
0:50-1:00 — GET INTO COSPLAY A

  [ ] Already laid out the pieces
  [ ] Film full cosplay shot first (the "before")

  [ ] Multiple angles of the cosplay
  [ ] Face close-up
  [ ] Full body

1:45-1:55 — SCRIPT 7: Trend Audio

  [ ] Film your version
  [ ] Film reaction

2:20-2:35 — SCRIPT 13: Types of Cosplayers

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I don't like how I look on camera"
```
- Everyone feels this way at first
- Watch your favorite creators — they felt the same
- Your 10th reel will look better than your 1st
- Focus on energy and personality, not perfection
- The audience wants authentic, not polished
```

### "I keep messing up the script"
```
- Don't memorize word-for-word
- Know the BEATS (the key points)
- Ad-libbing is fine — it sounds more natural
- Keep camera rolling, just start the line over
- You'll edit out the mistakes
```

### "My lighting looks bad"
```
- Move closer to the window
- Film between 10am-2pm for best natural light
- Face the light source, never put it behind you
- If using ring light: arm's length away
- Overexposed > underexposed (easier to fix)
```

### "I ran out of time"
```
- Prioritize: Scripts 1-4 are the most important
- Better to have 4 good reels than 8 rushed ones
- Schedule a mini-session for remaining scripts
- Some reels (DM reactions) take 10 minutes total
```

### "I don't have a second cosplay"
```
- Session 2 can be more casual content
- Re-film favorites from Session 1 with different energy
- Use pieces of cosplays (wigs, accessories)
- Personal/real talk content doesn't need cosplay
```
